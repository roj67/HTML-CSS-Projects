             <p>Born in ulm ,wuttembery germany in 1979, albert einstein had a passion for inquiry that eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity. in 1921, he who the nobel prize for physics for his explantionof the photoelectic effect and immigrated to the us in the following decade after begin targeted by the nazis . einstein is generally considered the most influential phusicist of thw 20 th century, with his work also having a maho impact on the development of atomic energy .with a focouts on unified field theory during his later years. einstein died on april 18, 1955, in princeton , new jersey.<br>

                Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.</li>
